## About the 30 Day Map Challenge

The [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a daily mapping and cartography challenge aimed at the spatial community. Every day in November, participants create maps based on different themes. This challenge is a great way to experiment with new tools, techniques, and data sources while improving your cartographic skills.
